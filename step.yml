title: Run npm command
summary: The Step runs npm with the command and arguments you provide, for example, to install missing packages or run a package's test.
description: |-
  You can install missing JS dependencies with this Step if you insert it before any build step and provide the `npm install` command. You can also test certain packages with the `test` command. You can do both in one Workflow, however, this requires one **Run npm command** Step for installation followed by another **Run npm command** Step for testing purposes.
  
  ### Configuring the Step
  1. Add the **Run npm command** Step to your Workflow preceding any build Step.
  2. Set the **Working directory**.
  3. Set the command you want npm to execute, for example `install` to run `npm install` in the **The npm command with arguments to run** input.
  4. If you're looking for a particular npm version, you can set it in the **Version of npm to use** input.
  5. You can cache the content of the node modules directory if you select `true` in the drop-down. By default this input is set to false.

  ### Troubleshooting
  Make sure you insert the Step before any build Step so that every dependency is downloaded a build Step starts running.
