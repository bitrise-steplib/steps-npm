# Run npm command

[![Step changelog](https://shields.io/github/v/release/bitrise-steplib/steps-npm?include_prereleases&label=changelog&color=blueviolet)](https://github.com/bitrise-steplib/steps-npm/releases)

The Step runs npm with the command and arguments you provide, for example, to install missing packages or run a package's test.

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

You can install missing JS dependencies with this Step if you insert it before any build step and provide the `install` command. 
You can also test certain packages with the `test` command. 
You can do both in one Workflow, however, this requires one **Run npm command** Step for installation followed by another **Run npm command** Step for testing purposes.

### Configuring the Step
1. Add the **Run npm command** Step to your Workflow preceding any build Step.
2. Set the **Working directory**.
3. Set the command you want npm to execute, for example `install` to run `npm install` in the **The npm command with arguments to run** input.
4. If you're looking for a particular npm version, you can set it in the **Version of npm to use** input.
5. You can cache the content of the node modules directory if you select `true` in the drop-down. 
By default this input is set to false.

### Troubleshooting
Make sure you insert the Step before any build Step so that every dependency is downloaded a build Step starts running.
